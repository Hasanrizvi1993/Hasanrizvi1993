🙋🏽‍♂️ My name is Hasan Rizvi. Nice to digitally meet you!

🌱 I am a results-driven, full-stack web developer with an MBA from California Baptist University. I am a passionate knowledge seeker and knowledge sharer.

👨🏽‍🏫 I am a firm believer in “If I don’t know it now, trust and believe, I will know it soon!” My main goal in life is to take complex information and demystify it for the interested, yet uninformed. 🧠

👨🏽‍🎓 My coding skill set includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, ReactJS, Django, Python, EJS, DTL, NodeJS, MySQL, NOSQL, MongoDB, Express, Heroku, Netlify and HandlebarsJS. I will take this information and combine it with my previous experience in Operations Management, customer service, and financial education in order to make the world a better place. 🌍
